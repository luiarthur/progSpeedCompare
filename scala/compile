# sbt is used for building scala projects. 

#  To install SBT, 
#  Download sbt from here:
#    http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-native-packages/org/scala-sbt/sbt/0.12.4/sbt.tgz
#    - Unpack the archive to a directory of your choice 
#    - Add the bin/ directory to the PATH environment variable. Open the file ~/.bashrc in an editor (create it if
#      it doesnâ€™t exist) and add the following line: export PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/sbt/bin:$PATH 
#    
#    Verify that sbt is installed correctly: Open a new terminal (to apply the
#    changed .bashrc) and type sbt -h, you should see a help message from sbt.
#    If you have problems installing sbt, ask for help on the forums.

sbt ~run # ~run compiles and runs like vulture
